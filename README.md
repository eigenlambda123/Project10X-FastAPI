# Project10X: The FastAPI Builder Series

A structured, hands-on journey through 10 backend projects, designed to progressively build and deepen API development skills using **FastAPI**, asynchronous programming, and modern Python backend tooling.

---

## Overview

This repository documents a curated sequence of FastAPI projects developed to explore asynchronous web API design in a practical, incremental way.

Each project focuses on production-style backend architecture, and includes:

* Core CRUD and RESTful logic
* FastAPI testing with `TestClient` and `pytest`
* Clean use of Pydantic models and validation
* Optional stretch goals for async integrations, caching, or external API use

Projects are structured to reflect real-world systems rather than isolated examples, with an emphasis on clean code, modular design, and deep mastery of FastAPIâ€™s async capabilities.

## Skills and Technologies

* Python 3.12+
* FastAPI (Async Web Framework)
* Pydantic for validation and serialization
* JWT Authentication & OAuth2 flows
* SQLModel (async DB ORM)
* PostgreSQL / SQLite
* `httpx` for async external API calls
* Redis and Celery (for background jobs and caching)

---

## Purpose

**Project10X: The FastAPI Builder Series** is designed as a deep learning track for mastering asynchronous API development in Python using FastAPI. It reflects a commitment to:

* Understanding async I/O and API design at a production level
* Testing and documenting APIs with clarity and completeness
* Applying FastAPI's full feature set: background tasks, external APIs, auth, caching, and deployment

---

## Usage

Each project includes:

* Clear setup instructions and dependency requirements
* A list of core features and optional stretch goals
* Backend tests for routes and logic
* Examples of query, path, and body parameter usage
* Tools for async workflows and real-world API use cases

This repo is open for exploration, learning, and contribution. Forks, pull requests, and suggestions are welcome.
